_Notes from Summer_: It’s halfway through February, which means the deadline for my poetry slam team to raise money for our crowdfunder is almost here! [Please, please donate](https://crowdfund.berkeley.edu/project/13578). We wanna do poems in Houston. Also, I was on TWO PODCASTS! Listen [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/dirty-pinko-commie/id1448981303) and [here](https://thequeerarabs.com/podcast/episode-49-palestine-poetry-pokemon-with-summer/). I love to talk!

_Notes from Jillian_: Happy Valentine’s Day! This time last year I was watching Gone Girl alone in my bed that I was subletting from a stranger in Crown Heights. Honestly? It was great. Hope you’re all being nice to yourselves today.

## We recommend…

### 🎶 Panic! At the Disco Live In Chicago

Okay, I know it’s 2019 and this is a ridiculous recommendation, but I still love Panic! just as much as I did eleven years ago. I was revisiting this live album and thinking about how sad I am I never got to see them in concert, and how sad I am that Brendon Urie will be in Oakland soon but I also won’t get to see him. But it’s okay! I can listen to Pretty. Odd. and cry just the same. You can listen to it [on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/2zuVGxuEzVhhRHNS2ZeRja?si=17kAcDcVTtanIZi6AYYHvw).

### 🎶 Kacey Musgraves
I shouldn’t even have to make this recommendation!!!!!! I’m sure you all know this by now!!!! Anyway, I didn’t watch the Grammys, but they were right about Kacey Musgraves. Her album [Golden Hour](https://open.spotify.com/album/7f6xPqyaolTiziKf5R5Z0c) has brought me so much joy this year. I return to it again and again, and it’s always just as good as the first time I heard it.

### 📺 One Day at a Time

I love comedy that makes me cry! The [third season] came out about a week ago and I, for once, didn’t binge the entire thing in an evening. I gave it a few days, drawing out my tears across many 1AMs. God bless a truly updated sitcom. Comedy grounded in love. Cheesey, episodic lessons with nuanced takes on shit that hurts. The episode about anxiety attacks fucked me up in particular--I won’t do too many spoilers but it’s really nice to see parents commiserating with their children about mental illness.

### ✉️ Griefbacon
I truly can’t believe it’s taken me this long to talk about [Griefbacon](https://griefbacon.substack.com/). What is wrong with me? Griefbacon is the best newsletter on the internet (aside from this one, duh). I’ve been subscribed since the very beginning, and I still get excited when a new letter lands in my inbox. Helena is a gorgeous writer, and her words have made me cry on more than one occasion, which is really the highest praise I can give anything. The free version of Griefbacon is great, but if you can spare $5/month, it’s well worth signing up for the paid subscription.
