It’s the last newsletter of 2018, y’all. Let’s get into it.

_Notes from Summer_: MY SEMESTER IS DONE AND I CAN RELAX (while I sift through fifteen books on diasporic poetry and poetics of memory!). All I want to do is watch cartoons, read poems, and make the occasional profit from editing other people’s work. Please send people to [my DMs](https://twitter.com/summabis) if they need some extra eyes. I have two that actually work really poorly but I do wear glasses!

_Notes from Jillian_: I’m in a book! The wonderful people at [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) have put together a book full of some of the projects made by the Glitch community this year, and I’m in it! [shouldidoit.glitch.me](https://shouldidoit.glitch.me/) is a website I made one afternoon because my boyfriend has a really hard time saying no to freelance work, and I wanted to make a tool that would help him figure out which projects are actually worth taking on—turns out that’s something a lot of us need. Check it out on page 20 of [Looky What We Made](https://glitch.com/culture/looky-what-we-made/).

## We recommend…

### 📖 the specimen’s apology by George Abraham, illustrated by Leila Abdelrazaq

George is my friend & kin & community; we found each other by way of Palestinian flags in our Twitter bios and, I would say, have been pals since. In addition to being my friend, they are also one of the most prolific writers I know, with a gajillion pubs that are all like, the Best Poem(s) You’ve Ever Read, a full length collection coming way of 2020, and their already-released chapbook _al youm_ is a masterpiece, demonstrating their ridiculous mastery of language as image and text as formula all at once. the specimen’s apology is no different, building and building upon George’s talent, making me wish I knew more math, making me re-read over & over again, making me want to write, making me warm, giving that overwhelming feeling of so much-ness. The illustrations by Leila are eerie/stunning, too, a perfect complement to George’s eerie/stunning work. Pre-order it [here](https://siblingrivalrypress.bigcartel.com/product/the-specimen-s-apology).

### 🎮 Stardew Valley multiplayer

[Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) might be only good thing we have left in this world, truly. If you don’t already know what it is, please google it, because I do not have time to explain to you how wonderful it is to log off for a few hours and escape into a world where the only thing I have to worry about is my adorable farm and its adorable chickens and my adorable purple-haired wife, Abigail.


Stardew Valley recently added multiplayer support for [PC](https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-3-multiplayer-update-is-now-available/) and the [Switch](https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-3-multiplayer-update-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-this-week/) and it is...fantastic. I’ve coaxed my boyfriend into playing with me a few times, and I plan to bug all of my friends to start playing with me too, because my dream has always been to live in side-by-side cabins and water plants with the people I love.

### 🍽️ Claire Saffitz making Gourmet Kit Kats

I was introduced to [Gourmet Makes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nqJiBRNQuw&index=4&list=PLKtIunYVkv_RezN3GB12YA8orYOScQUdA) by two friends attempting to reel me in from an anxiety spiral...it was the perfect choice. It is a well-known fact that I love watching food get made and I also love people trying their best and Claire Saffitz is a beautiful combination of both. The most wonderful thing about this series is the absolute lack of payoff—Claire presents perfectly recreated junk food to her colleagues at Bon Appetit, they take a bite, and say _good job_. It seems anticlimactic, but I know the feeling captured in her tired smile. I can’t say I’ve replicated kit-kats before in my kitchen’s shitty, shitty oven, but I have cooked meals that my friends have liked. I have cooked meals that my friends have liked even though I was floundering the entire time. The affirmation that even though you don’t know what you are doing, _you do know what you are doing_ is the only good feeling. The payoff is joy. You can learn a little food science, too.

### 💡 Furry coats

I recently met the love of my life and it is [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/BqsKzeIFvu7/) ridiculous furry blue coat that I bought myself as “self-care.” Ever since I read [this Amanda Mull piece](https://www.racked.com/2017/11/3/16577514/silly-coat-faux-fur-fun) on silly winter coats, I’ve been jealous of everyone I see wearing huge, furry, colorful jackets like it’s the most casual thing in the world. So I finally did it! And it was the best purchase I’ve made in a long time. 10/10 highly recommend.
