## Our 2019 favorites

It's hard to believe we've been doing this newsletter for over a year, but here we are! For our last letter of 2019, we took a look back at everything we recommended this year and chose our absolute favorites to revisit. Here are the ten things we still really love—maybe you'll love them too.

## We recommend

### 🍽 Reem’s Muhammara Recipe

I talk about Reem's all of the time, and I think about [this muhammara](https://www.aramcoworld.com/Articles/July-2019/Flavors-Reem-s-Muhammara) everyday; I won't make it again until I have a bigger food processor, but I treasure the experience, weirdly, of peeling the red bell peppers while they cool down, sort of blistering my hands, knowing how much I truly love making food. You can read my original recommendation [here](https://letterstosummer.com/18).

### 📱 Youper

In the past year, I've gotten really into journaling and mood tracking, and [this app](https://www.youper.ai/) has been my daily companion in both. I loved it when I wrote [my original recommendation](https://letterstosummer.com/13), and I still love it now.

### 📖 *Hard Damage* by Aria Aber

I started re-reading this the other day, cementing it as my favorite of 2019; Aria is brilliant and heartbreaking. [Buy her book](https://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/university-of-nebraska-press/9781496215703/), and read my original recommendation [here](https://letterstosummer.com/20).

### 🎉 XOXO

I have gone to Portland for [XOXO](https://xoxofest.com/) two years in a row, and I feel very certain that I will continue going every year for as long as possible. When I [first shared it](https://letterstosummer.com/22) in this newsletter, I had just gotten back from my second time attending this weird, wonderful conference, and I was already looking forward to going back. So I'll say it again: if you have the opportunity, please go.

### 📺 Polygon's Unraveled

[Brian David Gilbert](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaDrN74SfdT7Ueqtwn_bXo1MuSWT0ji2w) continues to make me laugh when I am very, very, sad. The videos just keep getting more elaborate and have given me comfort most consistently throughout 2019. [I'm saying nothing new!](https://letterstosummer.com/11)

### 🍽️ No-knead bread

I made a lot of bread this year, and almost all of it was [this no-knead bread](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-noknead-bread-home-109343) that I am still in love with. It's easy, great for beginners, and very delicious. [My original recommendation](https://letterstosummer.com/8) still rings true—this bread has never let me down.

### 📖 *Kingdom Animalia* by Aracelis Girmay

I'll never shut up about [this book](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780140559965?aff=PublishersWeekly)! I read it in June and I read it in August and I'll read it again and again and again and again once I get my own copy! I am chasing that feeling of *overwhelmed* with every piece of media I engage with and this one will never stop giving. I love it. Read my first recommendation [here](https://letterstosummer.com/22).

### 📱 Cute-ify your calendar

If you are using a calendar app (I am using three, because I'm me) you should [put some effort into making it nice to look at](https://letterstosummer.com/14). All of my event names have emojis in them, and my calendars are light pinks, purples, and peaches—because default colors are boring!

### 🎶 Rilo Kiley’s The Execution of All Things

Surprisingly, Rilo Kiley didn't end up being one of my Spotify wrapped top 5 artists. However, many of the songs from the album were on my top 100 playlist—*A Better Son / Daughter* near the top. [This album](https://open.spotify.com/album/23EqcK0ZR1ravQaEsGpQyH) came near the end of my 2019 when I truly needed a new way to communicate certain feelings. It helped and it continues to help. If you want my raw, spiral-y reaction, [that's in Letter 23](https://letterstosummer.com/23).

### 📖 *How to Not Always Be Working* by Marlee Grace

[This book](https://www.amazon.com/How-Not-Always-Working-Creativity/dp/0062803670/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1554865512&sr=8-1https://www.amazon.com/How-Not-Always-Working-Creativity/dp/0062803670/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1554865512&sr=8-1) has stayed with me every day since I read it. If you are struggling under the weight of projects and side-hustles and to-do lists, this book is for you. I [mentioned earlier](https://letterstosummer.com/24) that I took notes while I read it, and I still revisit those notes from time to time, whenever I need to remind myself to take a break from work.
