*A little housekeeping update: we’ve always done our best to have these newsletters published on Thursdays, but we decided to switch to Fridays because it fits our schedules better! Okay cool nice good. Enjoy.*

## On Fridays

Fridays have become very different for me in the past few months, because my company introduced a four-day workweek (very very very good). At first, I took every new Friday off to just do nothing, to just rest. To be lazy and play video games for hours and ignore all my responsibilities. Because I needed it! But it’s hard, I think, to detach yourself from the idea that weekdays—including Friday—are for working. So I’ve since fallen into a routine where I get up at the same time I get up for work the rest of the week and try to accomplish a few chores or personal tasks at least, while still taking the day slowly and giving myself plenty of time for rest and “fun” stuff.

There is an incredible relief in my body when I reach the end of the week; there is something sleepy and lethargic about Fridays, even if I have an immense amount to do. When my Fridays are busy are when I am the most exhausted the day after. Sometimes I think my body sort of holds onto the manifestation of exhaustion—I don’t get the aches/pains/agonies until I can really release them, which is Saturday (despite the many to-do lists I build for my weekends). There’s almost an allowance to myself for how I spend my evening, with no regards to consequence—because it’s Friday!

## We recommend

### 📖 Language of Baklava

My friend Samia read Diana Abu-Jaber’s *Crescent* last year and enthusiastically recommended her work to me; I remembered reading about her memoir *The Language of Baklava* back when I was writing my senior thesis. I had never thought to pick it up, for some reason, despite it literally being a food memoir by an Arab American until Samia’s encouragement, and oh my god! Fuck! Not only do I wish I had read this book four years ago, I ALSO wish I had read it ten years ago! It’s so fun and gorgeous and heart-warming; I’m going to attempt the recipes that bracket the end of each memory. I’m now completely devoted to Abu-Jaber and can’t wait to dive into the rest of her work. Buy it [here](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/363/the-language-of-baklava-by-diana-abu-jaber/)!

### 📺 Crash Landing on You

I just finished watching [this kdrama](https://www.netflix.com/title/81159258) last week and it destroyed me so completely, in the best way. Like, fully ripped out my insides and chewed them up and spit them back out into my body and zipped me back up and swaddled me in a blanket and gave me a kiss on the forehead. I feel like a changed person!!! Watch if you like the agonizing slow burn of two people who are basically destined to be together but can’t be without facing a ton of obstacles.

### 📺 Abbott Elementary

Quinta Brunson is showrunning this workplace mockumentary!!! It’s very funny and sweet and is sure to be the Next Big Sitcom, in my opinion. I love having something to look forward to weekly, also, feeling very retro by watching something on basic network television (ABC) and not binging it. Highly recommend! It airs Tuesday nights on ABC, or watch it on [Hulu](https://www.hulu.com/series/abbott-elementary-7c33eeb2-5d16-4a10-ad9e-ee31f9fff15c) the next day.

### 🔗 Hatomori

I’m a big fan of Yan’s art, so the second she opened [her shop](https://www.hatomori.art) up I ordered a few stickers and prints that I’m really excited about! Go take a look and give her a [follow](https://twitter.com/hatomori_) for more cute cute cute stuff.
